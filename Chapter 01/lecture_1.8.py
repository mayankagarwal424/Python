# 1st program
a = "Mayank"
b = "Agarwal"
n = a+b
print(n)

# 2nd program
l1 = [1, 2, 3]
l2 = [4, 5, 2, 5]

l = l1 + l2
print(l)

# 3rd program
n1 = 10+3*5
# The expected answer was 65, which is incorrect. The correct answer turns out to be 25, is due to what is called the "operator precedence".
